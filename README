AffectSampler --

This is a personal informatics project for Android, intended to 
help you perform "experience sampling": quickly capture
time-series data about your mood at configurable random intervals
through the day.

The idea will be to synchronize this to a server, and perform
further analysis to try and identify what drives changes in mood:
 - Weather?
 - Money?
 - Exercise?
 - Location?
 - Calendar activities?
 - Other public data streams; news flow, Twitter sentiment?
 - Personal data streams, logged by service like your.flowingdata.com?

It's being tested only on an HTC Hero at the moment.

TODO:
 - Synchronization to a web service (YFD or a custom REST store?)
 - Store location info
 - Configurable axes for each data point
 - Something like Chernoff faces/ MPEG4-FAP to parametrically
   draw a face reflecting the state of the mood sliders?
 - A web app to do analysis: cross correlation, trends...

- Initial upload, saving fixed 'emotion' 'intensity' points on 
  a scale of 0-1.0 to a SQLite db on the phone.  Line charts

  a comment to each data point.
