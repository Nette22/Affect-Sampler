This is the server side of AffectSampler, written in 
Python 2.5 to run on Google App Engine.

It's based on http://code.google.com/p/gae-json-rest/ .

The aim is:
 
* Take HTTP POSTs of JSON-serialized sample data from the
  client
* Detect if they are duplicates, add them as new entries if not - 
  idempotency.

* Return the latest stored update so the client knows
  where to start posting from.

* Return the data for queries

We are using longs (IntegerProperty) to store the date fields
for simplicity of serialization.
